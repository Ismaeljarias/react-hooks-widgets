This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React hooks widgets with Semantic UI

Here we have some UI widgets:
`Accordion`
`A Wikipedia Search`
`Dropdown`
`Translate`

All of them made with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and also the Navigation was made from scratch to practice and have better understanding of how [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/) work.

This is a great example of how to use some of the built in hooks of React.
